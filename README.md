## Traffic Volume Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python code for analyzing traffic volume data using the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The dataset used in this analysis is called "Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv."

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about traffic volume and weather conditions recorded at various dates and times. It includes the following columns:

- `holiday`: Categorical variable indicating whether the date is a holiday or not. If it is not a holiday, the value is "None."

- `temp`: Numeric variable representing the temperature in degrees Kelvin at the given date and time.

- `rain_1h`: Numeric variable representing the amount of rain measured in millimeters within the last hour at the given date and time.

- `snow_1h`: Numeric variable representing the amount of snow measured in millimeters within the last hour at the given date and time.

- `clouds_all`: Numeric variable representing the percentage of cloud cover at the given date and time.

- `weather_main`: Categorical variable indicating the general weather condition at the given date and time (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clouds, etc.).

- `weather_description`: Categorical variable providing a more detailed description of the weather condition at the given date and time (e.g., scattered clouds, broken clouds, overcast clouds, etc.).

- `date_time`: Date and time information of the recorded data point.

- `traffic_volume`: Numeric variable representing the traffic volume recorded at the given date and time. This is the target variable.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: The initial steps include loading the dataset and exploring its structure using the `info()`, `head()`, and `tail()` functions.

2. **Traffic Volume Distribution**: Visualizing the distribution of traffic volume using a histogram plot.

3. **Time-Based Analysis**: Splitting the data into day and night traffic based on the time of day. Analyzing the traffic volume for day and night separately using histogram plots.

4. **Traffic Volume Variation by Month**: Plotting the average traffic volume variation across different months using a line plot.

5. **Traffic Volume Variation by Year (July)**: Focusing on the month of July and visualizing the average traffic volume variation across different years within July.

6. **Traffic Volume Variation by Day of the Week**: Analyzing the average traffic volume variation across different days of the week using a line plot.

7. **Traffic Volume Variation by Hour (Weekdays vs. Weekends)**: Comparing the average traffic volume variation by hour between weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekends (Saturday and Sunday) using line plots.

8. **Correlation Analysis**: Computing the correlation between traffic volume and other numerical variables using a correlation matrix.

9. **Scatter Plot**: Creating a scatter plot to observe the relationship between traffic volume and temperature.

10. **Traffic Volume Variation by Weather Conditions**: Analyzing the average traffic volume variation based on different weather conditions using bar plots.

### Conclusion

The provided Python code offers a comprehensive analysis of the traffic volume dataset, including traffic volume distribution, time-based variations, and the influence of weather conditions on traffic volume. The visualizations and insights obtained from this analysis can aid in understanding traffic patterns and planning for better traffic management strategies.
